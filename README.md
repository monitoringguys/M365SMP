# M365SMP - M365 Supplemental Management Pack 
The M365 Supplemental Management Pack includes synthetic transactions that provide an increased level of visibility into the health of the Microsoft 365 environment. Making it the perfect companion to the M365 Admin Portal. We are providing this supplemental management pack for customers who leverage System Center Operations Manager as their monitoring platform. The supplemental management pack described in this document provides a deeper view into the health of the on-premises and cloud environment. The management pack will execute these synthetic transactions from a local point-of-presence (Watcher Node) within the customer network for a comprehensive view of service availability.
